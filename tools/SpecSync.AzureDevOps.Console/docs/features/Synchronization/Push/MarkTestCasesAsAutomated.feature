Feature: Mark Test Cases as Automated

Rule: Test Cases can be marked as automated

@tc:134
Scenario: Test Case is marked as automated

		Scenario: Sample scenario
			Given there is something
			When I do something

Scenario: Associated automation is removed when configuration is changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project

Rule: Marking Test Cases as automated can be limited to scenarios using tag expressions
